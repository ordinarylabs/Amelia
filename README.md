# Amelia

Multi-dimensional document/graph viewer.

# Mission

File trees, links, and graphs are cool, but the thing that seems to be missing right now is an ergonomic mechanism for floating through multi-dimensional space, with your current document or keyword anchoring as your pivot.

The aim of Amelia is to define a tool which orients the user more like the pilot of a spacecraft, navigating from planet to planet, where the "planets" are ideas, keywords, and documents. Amelia in its ideal state could be experienced both as the futuristic space map that the pilot would use to navigate, and as the universe of information, being navigated.
